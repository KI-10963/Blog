## Team Members 

1. Angel Cedillo
2. Jeremia Argueta
3. Jesus Garza
4. Dominic Baeza

**Sponsor** : Tish Wallace

## Building

We have attached an arm with two servos that allow us to operate the claw ( grab ) and can also move up and down. We are also attaching sides in order to properly display our team number. 
We spent some time labeling our tool box and our electronics

## Business

We were able to order from **Rev Robotics** for parts to help us have a smarter robot, such as sensors.

## Programming

Angel is programming the robot to use the new servos to control the arm
